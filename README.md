# DoD-Alice-MP

Multiplayer version of DoD rework, for Alice.


## How to play?

Since the game is heavily rebalanced, forget what you learnt from vanilla - it's going to be harmful:

### Do's and don't's!

- **DO NOT** tax 100% or tariff 100%, you will face the consequences if you have a weak economy (rebels mainly)
- **DO NOT** max spend on education and admin, unless you can afford to
- **DO NOT** declare war without checking alliance blocs first
- **DO NOT** spam units of "lower quality" to win - regiments are more of "quality" over "quantity" (for unit types), do not spam irregulars or you will lose all your soldier pops!
- **DO NOT** go to war without a strong economy and some reserve cash
- **DO NOT** spam building industries, you will go bankrupt immeadiately
- **DO NOT** spend money in events, or you will go bankrupt if you can't afford it
- **DO NOT** get into debt if you don't know how to use it - otherwise you'll go bankrupt

- **DO** use domestic slider as high as you can if you're laissez faire
- **DO** get strong allies if you're a secondary power, especially great powers
- **DO** colonize africa IF you can afford it (war is costly!)

### Extra notes when playing
- AI will always **try to** go for the historical path unless there is player intervention
- Africa severely lacks flavour, so if you want more Africa flavour *just ask for it*
- Substates gameplay boils down to civilizing, and either becoming independent or submitting (instant game over)

## Changes

- War exhaustion has been reduced considerably, but it can start to add up if you are at war for a long period of time (+3 years)
- Casualties now are extremely devastating for your POPs, so you should take care of your armies
- Made national focuses even more powerful, especially party loyalty ones
- Generals and Admirals are now considerably rarer, and die faster; they however amass more prestige
- You're able to mobilize way more if you're jingoist or pro-military
- Same with Armors with Infantry
- Regiments minimum size is 1,000 instead of 3,000
- Understaffed regiments, basically you don't magically spawn soldiers, the number of soldiers on the brigades actually correspond 1:1 to a POP
- Wartime soldier promotion increased
- Less conservative UH changes when doing reforms
